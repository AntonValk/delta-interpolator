<figcaption align = "center"><b>Demonstration of the proposed $\Delta$-interpolator approach (right, green), Linear interpolator baseline (middle, yellow), ground truth motion (left, white). Positional errors are indicated using red mask. When the model receives keyframe inputs that cause the interpolator to produce infeasible motion, e.g., top left and top right, the model is still able to apply a non-linear (and highly non-trivial) correction and approximate the ground truth. Even when the model fails to produce the ground truth output, the model still produces realistic looking motion (bottom left and right). </b></figcaption>
